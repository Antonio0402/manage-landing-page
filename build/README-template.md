## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com) - Tailwindcss

### What I learned

- A totally new approach to write all CSS properties by using utilities classes in constructing entire website
- Create a custom slider by using a JS library. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

### Continued development

- I am going to keep trying to have a good grasp of using Tailwinds class in advanced projects. 
- The background pattern is quite a bit of challenge as it can cause the  horizontal scrolling 's overflow on small screens. Hence, I am trying to find a optimal solution for such pattern instead of using background image properties.

So much thanks specially to Kevin Powel Youtube Chanel for helping me get through this project as well as being simplified complicated and confusing CSS's topic. Also Scrimba Tailwind CSS Tutorial courses were to be considerable contributions to my Tailwindcss foundation's since those early days of the project.
